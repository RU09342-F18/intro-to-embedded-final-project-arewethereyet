For this project, a program was created that could be loaded on to an MSP430 processor to create a 'parking sensor.'  
For this purpose, timers, I/O pin modulation, for and while loops, and if else statements were used.  The I/O pin 
modulation worked on a row of 6 LEDs; three green, two yellow, and one red, in that order.  The ultrasonic sensor
detects the distance of objects within a range of 32 to 4 cm and relays this information to the MSP430. The processor 
then uses this information to light up the LEDs accordingly.

To construct the circuit for this MSP430 parking sensor the following parts must be acquired: a breadboard, an 
MSP430G2553 processor chip, an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, 3 green LEDs, 2 yellow LEDs, 1 red LED, 6 1000 ohm 
resistors, and connectors and jumpers of various lengths. First, the chip is installed on the breadboard and each 
required I/O pin is connected to the anode of its corresponding LED; P1.3 is connected to green LED 1, P2.0 is 
connected to green LED 2, P2.3 is connected to green LED 3, P2.4 is connected to yellow LED 1, P2.5 is connected 
to yellow LED 2, and finally P2.7 is connected to the red LED. The cathode sides of all 6 LEDs are connected to 
ground using 6 1000 ohm resistors to limit current flow.  Next, the HC-SR04 is installed on the circuit with the 
sensing side pointing away from the LEDs and wiring. The ECHO pin of the sensor is then routed to P1.1 of the 
processor, while the TRIG pin is routed to P1.2. Finally, a 5V power source must be obtained, and the Vcc pins of
both the processor and the ultrasonic sensor connected to 5V, with their ground pins connected to ground. Once 
power is applied to the constructed circuit, the parking sensor will automatically power up and be ready for use.
